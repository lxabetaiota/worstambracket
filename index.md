## Current Status

On to the Sweet Sixteen! Results from Round 2:

- **1. Powers vs. 33. Chris** - **Powers Advances 7-0** - No shock here as the first showing of our overall number 1 seed is a quick dismantling of Chrith with a Swiffer swipe to the mouth.

- **16. Crowley vs. 48. Crean** - **Crowley Advances 7-1** - Crean's cinderalla run is stopped before it even began. No dunk city for Butters.

- **8. Dan Jordan vs. 40. Climan** - **Dan Jordan Advances 5-2** - Despite complaining about the integrity of the tournament, Climan still gets dropped rather easily by Dan.

- **9. Tommy Leblanc vs. 41. Greg** - **Tommy Leblanc Advances 3-2** - Greg nearly pulls off one of the upsets of the tournament in a grueling, low-scoring affair that reminds one more of a soccer game than an AM vote.

- **4. Hunter vs. 36. Klem** - **Hunter Advances 8-1** - Hunter's mysterious dissapearance last year has no effect on his tournament efficiency. He destroys Klem, but Klem ended up losing his $420 bet on a shutout.

- **5. Peter Nelson vs. 28. Joe Camel** - **Peter Nelson Advances 5-3** - Joe's close connection to AM of the year candidate Joe Kunetz probably grabbed him some votes, by Peter still takes him out.

- **13. Blake vs. 45. Eisenlord** - **Blake Advances 6-1** - Eisenlord was unfortunately too big to fit in the Cinderalla outfit I bought for him and was unable to make a longer run.

- **12. Andrew Vena vs. 21. Mike George** - **Mike George Advances in OT 4-4** - Our second tie of the tournament! Mike George advances in the super fair, well thought out tiebreaker of Cee-Lo.

- **2. Kunetz vs. 34. Pete Lithen** - **Kunetz Advances 9-0** - 52% of bracket challenge brackets had Kunetz winning it all, and he shows up in his first appearance with a shutout win over Pete.

- **15. Sean vs. 18. Angelo** - **Angelo Advances 4-2** - Bobby was clearly a bad influence on Angelo.

- **7. Dylan vs. 26. Keith** - **Dylan Advances 8-0** - Is this a dark horse in the making? Dylan impresses with a shutout.

- **10. Lonny vs. 23. Cisco** - **Lonny Advances 5-2** - I think Cisco bribed the voters with free personal training sessions, but we're a corrupt organization so we don't really care. Take it up with the FBI.

- **3. Haralambos vs. 35. Erik** - **Haralambos Advances 5-1** - Erik made it further than most expected, but it was not enough to take down the juggernaut that is Bobby Brackets

- **14. Will Thompson vs. 19. Sabrick** - **Will Thompson Advances 6-3** - Be on the lookout for blackout Sabrick in mourning of his brutal loss to Will.

- **6. Knatz vs. 27. James** - **Knatz Advances 6-1** - The family matchup ends in tears. They decided to go with a classic Snoop Dogg smoke off and Knatz easily takes down James' lungs.

- **11. Tom Hunter vs. 22. Dave** - **Tom Hunter Advances 4-3** - Some fans are citing PEDs taken by Dave while in New Zealand, but we think it makes for good TV and will uphold the results of this matchup.



Results from Round 1:

- **22. Dave vs. 43. Nico** - Closer than expected, with Dave pulling out a 6-3 victory **Dave advances**

- **27. James vs. 38. Pheng** - Ended in a tie 4-4! The matchup went to OT Cee-Lo and James unfortunately rolled a 1-2-3 on his first roll **James Advances**

- **19. Sabrick vs. 46. Kenny** - 6-2 Sabrick **Sabrick advances**

- **30. Hodor vs. 35. Erik** - Erik squeaks by to the next round with a 4-3 victory **Erik advances**

- **23. Cisco vs. 42. Joe A** - Cisco pulls out an easy victory 6-2, maybe Joe needs to try drinking some more Burnetts **Cisco advances**

- **26. Keith vs. 39. Joey H** - Low scoring affair, Keith wins 5-1 **Keith advances**

- **18. Angelo vs. 47. Pat** - No surprise here, Angelo drops Pat with a shutout 6-0 **Angelo advances**

- **31. Jason vs. 34. Pete L** - Pete complaining openly about the selection committee probably hurt his chances here, he won 5-2 **Pete advances**

- **21. Mike George vs. 44. Felice** - The AM for a week wins with a Virginia like score of 4-1 **Mike George advances**

- **28. Joe Camel vs. 37. Cole** - Our 2nd shutout, with Camel dropping Cole 6-0 - **Camel advances**

- **20. Kurtis vs. 45. Eisenlord** - Much closer than expected, Eisenlord packing 12 girls into a single ride just barely dropped him below Kurtis. Kurtis advances 4-3 - **Kurtis advances**

- **29. Matt L vs. 36. Klem** - Raptor arms do not make cleaning easily. The voters clearly thought so as well. Klem advances 6-3 **Klem advances**

- **24. Dave Forge vs. 41. Greg** - Somehow Greg lost this one to a fictional character 4-3 **Greg advances**

- **25. Billy Ma vs. 40. Jon Climan** - Billy Ma, the wunderkind of a brother, loses to Climan 6-3 **Climan advances**

- **17. Brooks vs. 48. Crean** - The most shocking upset of the round, Crean edges out Brooks 4-3 **Crean advances**

- **16. Crowley vs. 49. Cosgrove** - Crowley wins 6-1 in may be the last installment of the Ginger Bowl before he loses the rest of his hair **Crowley advances**

- **32. Steve vs. 33. Chris** - I'm pretty sure Steve's mob goonies threatened to kill the voters here. Chris wins 5-2 **Chris advances**
